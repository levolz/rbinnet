Description: Bayesian edge screening and structure selection for the Ising 
    model using continuous spike-and-slab prior distributions. A mixture of 
    two normal prior distributions are stipulated on the interaction effects to
    model edge inclusion and exclusion. A standard normal prior is stipulated 
    on the main effects. Hyperparameters for the normal mixture are 
    automatically determined by fixing the type-1 error. The details of this 
    procedure can be found in Marsman, Huth and Ntzoufras (2020). The prior 
    distribution on the structures (configurations of edges) is either uniform,
    or uniform on structure complexity (Beta(1,1)-Binomial). The EM variable 
    selection approach of Ro"\U+010D"kov"\U+00E1" and George (Journal of the 
    American Statistical Association, 109(506):828-846, 2014) is used for edge 
    screening and the SSVS approach of George and McCulloch (Journal of the 
    American Statistical Association, 88(423):881-889, 1993) is used for 
    structure selection.
